	    <h2>success</h2>
	    <p>Thank you, <strong>{{ name }}</strong>, for authorizing twauth-web an access token for <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ screen_name }}">@{{ screen_name }}</a>. We've successfully received your access token and confirmed it by retrieving some basic details on your behalf from the Twitter REST API. Yay!</p>
	    <p>Here is what we pulled from the API on your behalf:</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li>You have Tweeted <span class="label label-success">{{ statuses_count }}</span> times.</li>
	    	<li>You have <span class="label label-success">{{ followers_count }}</span> followers.</li>
	    	<li>You follow <span class="label label-success">{{ friends_count }}</span> handles.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>That's it, there's nothing left for you in this demo. Now, because this is a demo and we don't want to access your data any longer, we've deleted our local copy of your token. You can be extra safe and revoke our token from your <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/applications">account settings</a> on Twitter.</p>
